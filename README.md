// Mini Challenge #6 "Odd or Even"
// This is a program that takes in a user's input, determines if the input is a valid number,
// then prints out if the number entered is odd or even before asking the user if they want to play again

// peer review: Griffin Parker

This program works well and does everything that the assignment asks. The only things I think could be improved upon are the ending loop and the user experience. I think that adding a Console.Clear() command at the top of the program would help the terminal look a lot better when the user is running the program multiple times. Also the way to end the program could be improved by using ready.ToLower() to make whatever the user types in all lowercase. so if they type 'End' or 'END' it would read their input correctly and end the program.
