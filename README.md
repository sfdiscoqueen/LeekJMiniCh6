This program works well and does everything that the assignment asks. The only things I think could be improved upon are the ending loop and the user experience. I think that adding a Console.Clear() command at the top of the program would help the terminal look a lot better when the user is running the program multiple times. Also the way to end the program could be improved by using ready.ToLower() to make whatever the user types in all lowercase. so if they type 'End' or 'END' it would read their input correctly and end the program.
